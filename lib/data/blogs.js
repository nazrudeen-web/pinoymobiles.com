      "Is the Galaxy S25 series worth upgrading to? We compare it against the S24 generation and help you decide which Samsung model fits your needs in 2025 – whether you prioritise AI, cameras or multitasking.",
    content: `
      <p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 series has arrived, and many S24 owners are wondering whether it's worth upgrading. In this comprehensive comparison, we'll break down the key differences between these two flagship generations.</p>
      
      <h2>Design & Build</h2>
      <p>Both phones feature Samsung's premium build quality with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection. The S25 introduces a slightly flatter design with more refined edges, while maintaining the familiar Galaxy aesthetic.</p>
      
      <h2>Display</h2>
      <p>The S25 series features the same excellent Dynamic AMOLED 2X displays, but with improved brightness levels reaching up to 2,600 nits peak brightness compared to 2,400 nits on the S24.</p>
      
      <h2>Performance</h2>
      <p>The Galaxy S25 is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, offering significant improvements in CPU and GPU performance. AI tasks are handled more efficiently thanks to the new NPU.</p>
      
      <h2>Camera System</h2>
      <p>While the hardware remains largely similar, Samsung has introduced new AI-powered features for better low-light photography, improved portrait mode, and enhanced video stabilization.</p>
      
      <h2>Battery & Charging</h2>
      <p>Battery capacities remain the same, but the more efficient chipset means the S25 should offer better battery life in real-world usage.</p>
      
      <h2>Verdict</h2>
      <p>If you're on an S24, the upgrade is marginal unless you heavily rely on AI features. For S23 or older users, the S25 represents a significant leap forward.</p>
